# CesiumUpload
An electron (desktop) project to upload files for cesium. Unlike cesium's first party web uploader, this application is actually more featured as it is capable of adding geotag data. It also directly uploads to Cesium's S3 Buckets instead of being proxied through Cesium's backend, meaning bulk uploads may be faster.
